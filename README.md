Step 2. Modify Users (Backend)
We have noticed that the ages given in the people.json file is incorrect, each user is actually 5 years older than stated in the JSON file. Rather than editing the file we now need to create a PHP file to pull in the JSON file's data, parse it as an array and increment each of the people's age by 5 years.

Create a PHP file that pulls in the data within people.json.
Assuming the data is correct, parse the JSON to an array.
Add 5 years to each of the users.
